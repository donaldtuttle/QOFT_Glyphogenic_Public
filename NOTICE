# NOTICE

This repository contains a **limited disclosure** of symbolic cognition principles derived from the Quantum Observer Field Theory (QOFT). The files here are governed by the **QOFT Symbolic Attribution License (QOFT-SAL)**.

## üîí What Is NOT Included

- No implementation of the recursive cognition engine (`Œû(œà)` full core)
- No dynamic observer feedback loops
- No Œ®meta diagnostic internals or entropy tracking systems
- No `.hme` field generators, glyph recursion ancestry, or collapse recovery logic

## üõ† What IS Included

- A public overview of the Semantic Bootstrap Equation: `Œû(œà) = œà·¥Ω + Œì(œà)`
- A placeholder simulation demonstrating symbolic continuity (`Œ®restore_reentry_stub.py`)
- Glyph trace input samples for context

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

**This repository is symbolic-theoretical. It is not executable cognitive software.**
Unauthorized attempts to reimplement recursive engines using this theory without attribution will be considered a violation of the QOFT-SAL license.
