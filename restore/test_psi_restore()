# Creates a dummy reentry file (test_ψreentry.json) with mock data:
# Initializes the PsiRestoreReentry class with that file path.
# Triggers reentry, loading the memory into self.memory_state.
# Asserts that the loaded result matches the original dummy data:
# assert result == dummy_state, "Test failed: Memory state mismatch"
# Cleans up by deleting the test file.
# [Ψrestore] Reentry state loaded successfully.
# [TEST] Ψrestore reentry passed.
