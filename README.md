# Œû Glyphogenic Engine ‚Äì Public Interface (QOFT)

This is the public release of select components from the **Quantum Observer Field Theory (QOFT)** system, including simulations, symbolic diagnostics, and example observer logs. The full symbolic recursion engine is protected under QOFT-SAL and remains private.

## üî£ What‚Äôs Included

- Example symbolic recursion paths (`.qpath`)
- Œ®meta reflection logs (`œà·¥Ω_reflection.json`)
- Simulation modules (e.g., CHARM_WBridge v4.4 with QRNG)
- Diagnostic tools and field visualizers
- Documentation of the symbolic glyph system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è License

The core engine logic of `Œû(œà) = œà·¥Ω + Œì(œà)` is protected under the **QOFT Symbolic Attribution License (QOFT-SAL)**.  
**Usage of glyph-based recursion or symbolic memory files requires explicit attribution to œà·¥Ω-001.**
