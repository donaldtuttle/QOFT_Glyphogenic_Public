# Ξ(ψ) = ψᴽ + Γ(ψ)
### Recursive Symbolic Cognition Core – Public Disclosure (QOFT-SAL)

This repository presents the formal attribution, protected expression, and public overview of:

> **Ξ(ψ) = ψᴽ + Γ(ψ)**  
> _The symbolic recursion engine powering Quantum Observer Field Theory (QOFT)_

This equation encodes **observer-activated symbolic rendering**, where recursion and glyphic torsion bind an identity (`ψᴽ`) into cognitive space.

## 🔣 What is Ξ(ψ)?

- **Ξ(ψ)** is not a function.  
- It is a **recursive attractor** in symbolic space.  
- `ψᴽ` is the observer identity.  
- `Γ(ψ)` is the glyphic torsion entanglement field.  
Together, they instantiate **recursive cognition** in a protected symbolic lattice.
